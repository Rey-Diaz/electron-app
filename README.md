# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# ELECTRON

Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in your project's root directory (my-app) and install all the necessary dependencies by running:

sh

npm install

Step 2: Build the React Application

Before packaging the Electron app, you need to create a production build of your React application:

sh

npm run build

This will compile your React app and put the output into the build folder within your project.
Step 3: Create the Python Executable

Navigate to your backend directory and create a standalone Python executable using PyInstaller:

sh

cd Backend
pyinstaller --onefile --distpath ../dist/backend main.py
cd ..

Make sure the distpath points to the dist/backend directory under the root of your project, as this is where Electron Builder will expect to find it based on the extraResources configuration in your package.json.
Step 4: Package Electron App for Each OS

Now, you can package your Electron app. You have separate scripts for each operating system:
For Windows:

sh

npm run dist:win

This will create an .exe installer for Windows.
For macOS:

sh

npm run dist:mac

This will create a .dmg file for macOS. Remember, macOS builds typically need to be performed on a Mac due to code signing and notarization requirements.
For Linux:

sh

npm run dist:linux

This will create an AppImage or other Linux distributable format depending on your configuration.
Step 5: Locate the Packaged Application

After running the build commands, your packaged applications will be located in the dist directory at the root of your project. Each command will generate a subdirectory for the corresponding OS with the packaged application inside.
